# When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:

- Setting up project documentation from scratch
- Creating or updating AGENTS.md as an AI entry point
- Organizing documentation hierarchy across a project
- Writing Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
- Applying the Diátaxis framework to existing docs
- Implementing Docs-as-Code methodology
- Structuring documentation to be consumable by AI agents between sessions
- Establishing documentation governance and update processes

**Triggers:** project documentation, AGENTS.md, documentation structure, ADR, Diátaxis, docs-as-code, documentation hierarchy, README-driven development, persistent memory, documentation governance.

## Core Workflow

### 1. Establish the Documentation Layer Hierarchy

Documentation operates at three layers:

**Global Layer** (Project-wide)

- README.md — project purpose, quick start, contribution guidelines
- AGENTS.md — AI agent entry point, or a short redirect to a richer manual such as CLAUDE.md when the repo has a separate operational source of truth
- CONTRIBUTING.md — contributor workflow
- LICENSE — legal framework

**System Layer** (Module/subsystem level)

- Module READMEs — subsystem purpose, exports, dependencies
- Architecture documentation — system design, component relationships
- ADR folder — decisions and their rationale

**Local Layer** (File/function level)

- Code comments — "why" not "what"
- JSDoc/docstrings — function signatures and intent
- Inline explanations — complex logic

### 2. Create AGENTS.md as AI Entry Point

AGENTS.md is often the first document an AI agent reads. It must either answer these questions directly or point clearly to the canonical manual that does:

- What is this project and why does it exist?
- What is the technology stack?
- How is the codebase organized?
- What are the key conventions?
- Where do I find deeper information?

Keep AGENTS.md concise. A practical default is under 500 lines, but a repository may intentionally keep AGENTS.md very short and delegate operational detail to `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/ai/boot/agent-preflight.md`, or another documented manual. In that pattern, update both the redirect and the canonical manual whenever architecture changes materially. Use the provided template in assets/agents-md-template.md only when the repo has no stronger local convention.

#### Required sections

- Project Overview (2-3 sentences)
- Tech Stack (with versions)
- Project Structure (folder tree with descriptions)
- Key Conventions (naming, patterns, standards)
- Architecture Overview (C4 Level 1 diagram)
- Important Files (critical file map)
- Known Issues (link to tracking)
- Further Reading (links to module docs, ADRs)

### 3. Implement Documentation Principles

#### Principle 1: Single Source of Truth

Each piece of information lives in exactly one authoritative location. Reference that location rather than duplicate. Example: API endpoint behavior documented once in API reference, not repeated in multiple guides.

#### Principle 2: Modularity

Each document is self-contained and can be read independently. Include necessary context rather than forcing readers to read prerequisites. Provide links for deeper exploration.

#### Principle 3: Metadata

Every non-trivial document must include: publication date, author/maintainer, status (draft/accepted/deprecated), scope (what it covers), and update frequency. Example:

```text
---
title: Database Schema Design
status: accepted
date: 2024-08-15
author: Backend Team
scope: Schema changes, migration procedures
updated: Monthly or when schema changes
---
```

#### Principle 4: Normative Language (RFC 2119)

Use precise language to indicate requirement strength:

- MUST/MUST NOT — absolute requirement
- SHOULD/SHOULD NOT — strong recommendation, deviation only with good reason
- MAY — genuinely optional
- CAN — technical capability without requirement

#### Principle 5: Traceability

Link backwards and forwards: Requirements → Decisions (ADRs) → Implementation → Tests. Enable navigation between abstraction levels.

### 4. Apply Diátaxis Framework

Organize documentation into four types:

**Tutorials** (Learning-oriented)

- Goal: Enable beginners to accomplish a basic task
- Structure: Step-by-step, assume minimal prior knowledge
- Example: "Getting Started with Project Setup"

**How-to Guides** (Task-oriented)

- Goal: Help someone accomplish a specific goal
- Structure: Steps toward goal, assume domain knowledge
- Example: "How to Add a New API Endpoint"

**Reference** (Information-oriented)

- Goal: Provide accurate, complete technical information
- Structure: Organized for lookup, not narrative
- Example: "Configuration Options Reference"

**Explanation** (Understanding-oriented)

- Goal: Deepen understanding of design decisions and tradeoffs
- Structure: Discuss context, alternatives, reasoning
- Example: "Why We Chose PostgreSQL Over MongoDB"

Every section of your documentation belongs in exactly one category. Mixing categories confuses readers.

### 5. Implement Docs-as-Code

- **Location:** Documentation lives in the repository alongside code
- **Format:** Markdown for all documentation
- **Versioning:** Docs are versioned with code (same commit SHAs)
- **Review:** Documentation changes reviewed in pull requests
- **CI Checks:** Automated link validation, spell check, orphaned doc detection
- **Publishing:** Build system generates HTML/PDF from source
- **Branching:** Apply same branching strategy to docs as code

### 6. Create ADRs for Significant Decisions

Use Architecture Decision Records to document "why" decisions were made. Store in `docs/adr/` folder, numbered sequentially (0001-xxx.md, 0002-yyy.md).

#### ADR Structure

- **Title:** Brief noun phrase describing the decision
- **Date:** When the decision was made
- **Status:** proposed, accepted, deprecated, superseded by ADR-XXXX
- **Context:** Problem statement, constraints, background
- **Decision:** What was decided and why (the "why" is critical)
- **Consequences:** Positive outcomes and tradeoffs

Example context: "We needed to cache user sessions across microservices without a shared database."
Example decision: "We chose Redis with JSON serialization because it provides sub-millisecond lookup and handles serialization transparently."
Example consequences: "Positive: 99th percentile latency improved 40ms. Negative: added Redis operational overhead; requires cache invalidation strategy."

### 7. Establish Documentation Update Process

- Add docs/ folder to PR template: "Does this PR require documentation changes?"
- Require docs updates for: API changes, config option changes, architectural changes, new deployment procedures
- Use automation to flag stale docs (last updated >6 months ago for fast-moving areas)
- Assign documentation review to appropriate team member in code review

### 8. Implement Known Issues Tracking

Maintain a KNOWN_ISSUES.md file to prevent AI (and humans) from "fixing" documented limitations. Format:

```text
## Issue: Slow Query on Reports Dashboard

Description: Generating reports >10K rows takes >30 seconds.
Impact: Users experience timeouts on large datasets.
Workaround: Filter dataset before report generation.
Planned Fix: Database indexing strategy (Q3 2026).
Status: Active
```

## Advanced Cases

**Multi-Team Projects:** Create team-specific READMEs within subsystem folders. AGENTS.md points to team entry points. Prevents documentation proliferation while maintaining clarity.

**Distributed Documentation:** When docs span multiple platforms (wiki, API docs, runbooks), create a "documentation manifest" that maps each doc type to its location and owner. Link from AGENTS.md to manifest.

**Evolving Architecture:** When planning architectural changes, write ADR before implementation. Update ADR.status to "proposed" first, gather feedback in PR, accept after discussion. This creates a decision history.

**Onboarding Scale:** As team grows, move role-specific docs (DevOps runbooks vs. frontend contributor guides) into separate docs but hyperlink from AGENTS.md. Progressive disclosure prevents cognitive overload.

**Legacy Code:** When documenting legacy systems, ADRs become even more critical. Document "why is it this way?" rather than "why isn't it the better way?" This respects existing knowledge and constrains refactoring.

## Fallback Clause

If critical information is missing from the documentation:

- Output `[INFORMATION NEEDED: {specific info}]` rather than inventing or guessing
- Flag in the document itself: `<!-- TODO: Architecture diagram pending -->` with date and owner
- Create tracking issue linked from doc
- Do not let missing information become an excuse to skip documentation; document what you know and mark gaps clearly

## Anti-Patterns

### Anti-Pattern 1: Documentation Separate from Code

Documentation in a wiki that's never updated with code changes. Result: stale, untrustworthy docs. Instead: docs live in repo, versioned with code.

#### Anti-Pattern 2: No AGENTS.md or stale redirect

AI agents must spend cycles inferring project structure or follow a pointer to an obsolete manual. Result: inconsistent navigation, missed dependencies. Solution: provide AGENTS.md and keep any redirect to CLAUDE.md or equivalent current.

#### Anti-Pattern 3: ADRs Without Context

ADR reads "Decision: Use PostgreSQL" with no context. Result: decision is meaningless to future readers. Solution: include constraints, alternatives considered, and reasoning.

#### Anti-Pattern 4: Monolithic Documentation

Single 50-page "Architecture Guide." Result: defeats progressive disclosure; AI loads unnecessary context. Solution: split by concern; link between docs.

#### Anti-Pattern 5: No Metadata

No publication date on docs. Result: reader can't assess freshness. Solution: include date, status, author, and update frequency on all docs.

#### Anti-Pattern 6: Mixing Diátaxis Categories

"How to" section that includes explanation of _why_. Result: tutorial readers get confused. Solution: keep categories pure; link between them.

#### Anti-Pattern 7: Documentation Debt

"We'll document it after launch." Result: never happens. Solution: document during development (README-Driven Development).

## Enforcement

This skill is MANDATORY and must be followed without exception when its trigger fires. Specifically:

- AGENTS.md must exist at project root before any AI agent onboarding, even if it is a short pointer to the canonical manual
- AGENTS.md and the canonical manual it points to must be reviewed and updated in every PR that materially changes architecture
- ADRs must be created for decisions with long-term implications (database choice, API design, auth strategy)
- Every documentation layer (Global/System/Local) must follow the principles outlined in Section 3
- Documentation updates must be part of the code review process (not a separate, optional step)
- Known issues must be tracked and linked to prevent incorrect "fixes" by AI or humans
